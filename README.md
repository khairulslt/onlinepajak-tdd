# TDD Assignment


to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

to run entire test suite (both unit and integration testing):

```
npm test
```

### Resources Used
Was new to TDD so I used a couple of posts as guidelines on how to format my tests.

- [End-to-end Testing with Mocha](https://watirmelon.blog/2016/02/19/testing-end-to-end-with-mocha/)
- [Mocha Unit Testing & Integration Testing TDD](https://blog.waffle.io/test-driven-development-breaking-down-unit-integration-tests-d4a723817419)

```
# Locate the path for the Python 3 installation
~~which python3~~
Get-Command python3

# Create the virtual environment in a folder named "env" in the current directory
virtualenv env --python=<path_to_python_3>

# Start the virtual environment (from 99-python-exercise directory)
<strike>source env/bin/activate</strike>
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
